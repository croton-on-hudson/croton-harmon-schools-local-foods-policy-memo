- designed to prop up food prices by purchasing surplus commodities

Act:

- Title 42 - THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND WELFARE CHAPTER 13 - SCHOOL LUNCH PROGRAMS
- Section 1758: https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2017-title42/pdf/USCODE-2017-title42-chap13-sec1758.pdf
- Section 1766: https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2017-title42/pdf/USCODE-2017-title42-chap13-sec1766.pdf

Requires local educational agencies to develop "local school wellness policy" - see specifics: https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1758b

## Child Nutrition Act of 1966

Due to the success of the National School Lunch Program, the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 was passed to expand the program to include breakfast and afterschool snacks.

- Act: https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1773
- the Special Milk Program, which reimburses schools for milk served to children, was also officially incorporated into the program
  - the milk is either fully free or partially subsidized, depending on the family's income
  - wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Milk_Program

### National School Lunch & Breakfast Programs

Govern the nutritional standards for all foods sold in schools, including vending machines, a la carte, and fundraisers.

Schools receive two kinds of benefits:

- cash reimbursements
- entitlements for USDA Foods

#### Cash reimbursements for elegible foods

- this makes up the majority of the benefits to schools
- currently ¢43 per lunch and ¢30 per breakfast meal served

#### Entitlement to order USDA commodities from USDA Foods

- entitlements are based on Total Lunches Served (TLS) from the previous year
  - this was waived for the 2020-2021 school year due to COVID-19 so schools wouldn't lose money, but is now back in place so schools will make less if fewere students are in school post-pandemic
- entitlements are given to the states, who then distribute them to the schools
- USDA Foods make up 15-20% of the foods served in the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs
- USDA Foods order bulk at a discount rate and pass those savings on to the schools using their entitlements

#### National School Lunch Program

- The main federal regulations surrounding school lunches.
- Title 7, Subtitle B, Chapter II, Subchapter A, Part 210 - https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-7/subtitle-B/chapter-II/subchapter-A/part-210

#### National School Breakfast Program

- The main federal regulations surrounding school breakfasts.
- Title 7, Subtitle B, Chapter II, Subchapter A, Part 220 - https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-7/subtitle-B/chapter-II/subchapter-A/part-220

#### Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act of 2004

- An amendment to the 1966 School Lunch Act, including the addition of the National School Breakfast Program.

### USDA Foods

A resource for maximizing school food budgets, while also proppping up agricuture

- USDA Foods are foods purchased by the USDA to support the domestic agriculture market and are then donated to the states to support NSLP participants.
- states, on behalf of schools, can order foods from USDA Foods using their entitlements from the National School Lunch and Breakfast Programs
- each State administers their USDA Foods entitlements and place bulk orders that they then distribute among the schools
- many States allocate a portion of their USDA Foods entitlement
  to processors to further process USDA Foods. For example,
  they may send entitlement beans to a processor to make baked
  beans or burritos, or send apples to a processor to be sliced. In
  this way, local processors can benefit from the program.
- USDA Foods also says buying from them frees up funds and allows schools to buy more expensive local foods with their reimbursement funds from the NSLP
- Fact sheet: https://www.fns.usda.gov/f2s/usda-foods

Ideas:

- since USDA Foods is designed to prop up the agriculture industry by buying up excess, if its own policies were modified to buy up excess from local farms, it could be a way to increase the use of local foods in schools

### USDA Department of Defense Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program

Schools may use their USDA Foods entitlement funds to purchase fresh fruits and vegetables from the USDA Department of Defense Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program (USDA DoD Fresh).

- an optional program schools may participate in with their USDA Foods entitlements
- managed by the Defense Supply Center of Philadelphia (DSCP) that operates a nationwide system to purchase and distribute a wide variety of high-quality fresh produce to military installations (see Indiana's [Handbook on USDA Foods](https://www.in.gov/doe/files/USDA-Foods-Distribution-Handbook-Updated-10-12-2022-v2.pdf) for some insight)
- provides many varieties of fresh produce grown in the US
- Vendors in the program must submit a plan showing products they purchase locally, growers they buy from, and a plan and resources for increasing local purchases
- includes locally grown produce "when in season".
  - "local" here is defined as produce from within the State or adjacent States
  - though schools may establish their own definitions of local
- The USDA DoD Fresh Fruits and Vegetables Order Receipt System (FFAVORS)...
  - includes State of Origin information for all products, so it's possible for schools to select local products
  - provides reporting capabilities so schools can run reports to see how much local produce they have ordered.
- Local produce must meet the same contract requirements for quality, food safety, and reasonable pricing as non-local produce in the USDA DoD Fresh Program
- Fact sheet: https://fns-prod.azureedge.us/sites/default/files/resource-files/dodfresh.pdf

Ideas:

- this program gives the opportunity to buy local within the current system
- if local producers must meet the same reasonable prices as non-local producers, then it limits what can be purchased locally; consider removing this constraint and subsidizing local producers within this program.

### Healthy, HungerFree Kids Act of 2010 (HHFKA)

https://www.fns.usda.gov/sites/default/files/resource-files/pl_111-296.pdf

- Championed by the Michelle Obama as part of her Let’s Move! initiative to solve the problem of childhood obesity within a generation
- Requires school districts to meet nutrition standards for school meals

### USDA Farm to School Program

The Farm to School Program helps child nutrition providers incorporate local foods through grants, research, technical assistance, and training.

- Information: https://www.fns.usda.gov/farmtoschool
- Farm to School Census: https://farmtoschoolcensus.fns.usda.gov/, including search by state: https://farmtoschoolcensus.fns.usda.gov/census-results/states/ny.
- Croton-Harmon does not seem to have participated in the Farm to School Census and does not show up in their SFA search tool.

Ideas:

- modify district policy to require school food-related occupations to participate in Farm to School training
- develop a plan to participate in the program

## NY State policies & programs governing school foods

### 30% Initiative

Increases reimbursements to schools spending at least 30% of total food costs for school lunch programs on NYS food products.

- "NYS Food Product" is defined as a food item that is grown, harvested, or produced in NYS OR is processed in or outside NYS comprising over fifty-one percent NYS agricultural raw materials
- Total reimbursement from NYS increases from ¢59 cents per meal up to a max of ¢25 per meal for program participants
- School Food Authorities (SFAs) must purchase and prepare meals themsleves or hire an FSMC to do so
- Website: https://agriculture.ny.gov/30-percent-initiative

- Croton-Harmon does not seem to have participated in the [Farm to School Census](https://farmtoschoolcensus.fns.usda.gov/) and does not show up in their SFA search tool. We may assume that they do not have a Farm to School program.
- Croton-Harmon Child Nutrition information: https://www.chufsd.org/Page/3067
- Croton-Harmon Wellness & Nutrition Committee: https://www.chufsd.org/Page/3081 - does not seem to include any community members

Ideas:

- update federally-mandated Wellness policy to mandate a certain percentage of local foods in school meals and a plan to increase that yearly
  - this will require bidders for the contract to include local foods in their bids
  - charge HMB Consultants with looking into how to increase local foods in supply from Aramark
- modify composition of Wellness & Nutrition Committee (including School Lunch Subcommittee)
